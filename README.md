Virtual AI Assistant for Lung Cancer Detection System


üöÄ Introduction
Welcome to the Virtual AI Assistant for Lung Cancer Detection! This powerful, interactive platform combines machine learning, modern frontend UI, and intelligent voice interactivity to help users interactively detect and understand lung cancer outcomes. It offers both text and voice-based support, giving users flexibility and accessibility.


üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- React (with Bootstrap) for frontend
- Flask (Python) for backend API
- Hugging Face Transformers for AI chatbot
- TensorFlow/Keras hybrid model for lung cancer classification
- Web Speech API for speech recognition and synthesis
- HTML5/CSS3 with responsive design and dark/light theme toggle
